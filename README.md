### Date created: October 10, 2016


# Getting Started

Navigate to the project root directory before running any commands. E.g.:

```$ cd /path/to/sinap-ide```

Be sure to install project dependencies before running:

```$ npm install```

If postInstall fails to run, typings dependencies can be installed with:

```$ npm run typings install```

Use the following command to run the application:

```$ npm start```

# Development Notes

index.html should not need to be changed. The only thing that should be changed
in index.ts is functionality for the main menu.

Everything else should be done in the scripts, styles, and html directories.
Please try to follow the conventions outlined by the Angular2 TS guide.
